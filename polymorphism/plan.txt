1. Classes (needed for implementation)
 - Figure
 - Circle
 - Rectangle
 - Triangle
 - Group
 - FigureContainer

2. Functions for each class (without polymorphic functions)
 - print
 - isInside
 - readFromFile
 - translate
 - ...

3. Inheritance and connections between classes.
 - Figure <- Circle
 - Figure <- Triangle
 - Figure <- Rectangle
 - FigureContainer [FigurePtr]
 - Group [FigureContainerPtr]

4. Main function implementstion details.
 - Initialization (read form file, load information)
 - Get commands (either main argc, argv[]; or do{}while())
 - Exit safely
